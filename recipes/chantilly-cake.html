        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li> 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jam Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon raspberry jam</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chantilly Cream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese, chilled</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, chilled</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy whipping cream, chilled</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh raspberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh strawberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and line 3 (8 inch) round cake pans with parchment
            paper; grease the parchment.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, sour cream, oil, vanilla, and almond extract until completely
            smooth and combined. Add in the dry ingredients and whisk until mostly incorporated. Add in milk, and whisk
            until batter is mostly smooth. Batter will be runny.</li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out mostly clean,
            25 to 30 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
            completely.</li>
        <li>To make jam syrup, mix together jam, water, and lemon juice in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave
            for 30 seconds, then stir until mixture is thoroughly combined. Brush jam syrup evenly over the top of
            cooled cakes.</li>
        <li>To make chantilly cream, beat together mascarpone and cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Add in
            heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing to medium
            high, beat mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Do not overbeat, or cream will curdle.</li>
        <li>To assemble, place 1 cake layer onto a plate or platter. Top with a hefty dollop of chantilly cream and
            spread into an even layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of berries over the top of the cream and gently press into the
            cream. Top with second cake layer, and repeat adding cream and berries. Top with the final cake layer. Cover
            top and sides of cake with remaining cream. </li>
        <li>Arrange remaining berries on top of cake as desired. Place cake into the refrigerator to chill for at least
            2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
